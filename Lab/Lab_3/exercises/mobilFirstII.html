                <h1>Fine-art photography</h1>
                <p>
                    Fine art photography is photography created in accordance with the vision of the artist as photographer. 
                    Fine art photography stands in contrast to representational photography, such as photojournalism, 
                    which provides a documentary visual account of specific subjects and events, 
                    literally re-presenting objective reality rather than the subjective intent of the photographer; 
                    and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products or services.
                </p>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    One photography historian claimed that "the earliest exponent of 'Fine Art' or composition photography 
                    was John Edwin Mayall, "who exhibited daguerrotypes illustrating the Lord's Prayer in 1851".
                    Successful attempts to make fine art photography can be traced to Victorian era practitioners such as Julia Margaret Cameron, 
                    Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, and Oscar Gustave Rejlander and others. 
                    In the U.S. F. Holland Day, Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen were instrumental in making photography a fine art, 
                    and Stieglitz was especially notable in introducing it into museum collections.
                    In the UK as recently as 1960, photography was not really recognised as a Fine Art. Dr S.D.Jouhar said, when he formed the Photographic 
                    Fine Art Association at that time - "At the moment photography is not generally recognized as anything more than a craft. In the USA photography 
                    has been openly accepted as Fine Art in certain official quarters. It is shown in galleries and exhibitions as an Art. There is not corresponding 
                    recognition in this country. The London Salon shows pictorial photography, but it is not generally understood as an art. Whether a work shows 
                    aesthetic qualities or not it is designated 'Pictorial Photography' which is a very ambiguous term. The photographer himself must have confidence 
                    in his work and in its dignity and aesthetic value, to force recognition as an Art rather than a Craft"
                    Until the late 1970s several genres predominated, such as; nudes, portraits, natural landscapes (exemplified by Ansel Adams). Breakthrough 'star' 
                    artists in the 1970s and 80s, such as Sally Mann, Robert Mapplethorpe, Robert Farber, and Cindy Sherman, still relied heavily on such genres, 
                    although seeing them with fresh eyes. Others investigated a snapshot aesthetic approach.
                    American organizations, such as the Aperture Foundation and the Museum of Modern Art, have done much to keep photography at the forefront of the fine arts.
